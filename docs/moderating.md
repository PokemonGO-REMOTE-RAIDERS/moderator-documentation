# Moderating

## Common Pok√©nav Command

### Basics
**Host**
- `.gtc` will post code
- `.boss` (name) updates boss info
- `.mm #` restricts lobby if less than 5
- `.m` shows team breakdown
- `.go` will tag to go in game for invites
- `.tr` time remaining
- `.extend 10` extends close time of raid
- `.end` closes raid 

**Members**
- `.htc` grabs host code 
- `.ready` to join raid 
- `.bye` leave lobby

**Moderating**
When we need to delete a raid you will delete the posting in #active raids, then delete manually in raid viewer.

### Raid Boss Tagging
**Via Boss role**
`@mega-gyarados` `@mewtwo` `@etc`

**Via Wave Rider role**
`@wave rider`

## Great practices

1. First of all you will want to add a few roles to yourself. 
	- @Raid viewer
	- @raid moderator. 
2. Once you have done this you will be able to see all the active raid rooms and how host is communicating with our members. It‚Äôs pertinent that they communicate. We don‚Äôt want any confusion. 
3. Start out by @ host and let them know: `Please communicate with your raiders.` 
4. If no response take note of thread and keep eye on host. They may not be fully aware of how to use pokenav. 
5. Give them a friendly tag and suggestion on checking out #deleted-channel. 
6. Now if host does still not respond. @ host to take a note. 
7. Go to troublemakers tab and enter note by using. ‚Äú,setnote @‚Äù 
8. Pull role from host and bring into snickers. 
9. Pull notes upon arrival in snickers so they know why they are there.

## Common Copy / Paste

### How do I raid here?
```
**How do I raid here??**
Let me list the ways..
- Raids using our raid bot that allow only 5 people to join in:
	#üì£mega_raids
	#üì£tie1-3_raids
	#dedicated-tier5
	(Best for when host only needs a few people for one run)
- Sign up for Wave Rider alerts in #üîìassign_roles_here then you will get notified when someone is hosting multiples waves in one of our wave channels.
- Open raid rooms like #raid-room-1 - 7 have raids that the host chose not to use the raid bot and will be single raids.
Tips for success: sign up for alerts when raids post in #üíñraid_notification_roles
```

7. If they respond, talk to them about the issue. 
8. If they don't respond, set a note in the chat so you or the next <span class="text-green">@manager</span> to pick it up knows what the issue was.
	- `,setnote <user> User was posting inappropriate images in gen chat.`
	- Post any evidence you may have here as well.

## Translator Bot

?> You can use this Bot only in <span class="text-blue">#‚úÖcommunity_chat</span> and the <span class="text-blue">#üö´what_happened_1‚É£</span> through <span class="text-blue">6</span>.

If user speaks another language chances are they may not know what your trying to portray to them.

When they comment back simply use the USA Emoji or Language of your choose to decipher.
