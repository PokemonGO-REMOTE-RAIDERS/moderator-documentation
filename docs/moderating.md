### How do I raid here?
```
**How do I raid here??**
Let me list the ways..
- Raids using our raid bot that allow only 5 people to join in:
	#📣mega_raids
	#📣tie1-3_raids
	#dedicated-tier5
	(Best for when host only needs a few people for one run)
- Sign up for Wave Rider alerts in #🔓assign_roles_here then you will get notified when someone is hosting multiples waves in one of our wave channels.
- Open raid rooms like #raid-room-1 - 7 have raids that the host chose not to use the raid bot and will be single raids.
Tips for success: sign up for alerts when raids post in #💖raid_notification_roles
